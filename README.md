# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Pyspark
Project that gives idea on how to use Pyspark on UNSW-NB datasets used for intrusion detection.
# PySpark
PySpark is collaboration of Apache Spark and Python.\n
PySpark also provide us MLlib which help in implementing ML algorithms.\n
Implementing queries on huge amount of data is difficult and Spark make our job easier.
